# Motor Learning Model

Contains some code used in "Somatosensory Cortex Plays an Essential Role in Forelimb Motor Adaptation in Mice" by Mathis et al. 2017, DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2017.02.049
http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30157-5

In particular, it contains the learning models based on sensory prediction errors to describe the adaptation data (Figure 2); currently considering SPE only.

To use this code, simply run `python KalmanFilter-learning.py`
